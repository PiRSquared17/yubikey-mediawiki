Installation
============

Create the directory $MW_INSTALL_PATH/extensions/Yubikey and copy all
files there.

Add the user mapping table, like this:

  mysql -h yourdbhost -u youradminuser -p yourwikidb < yubikey_table.sql

Add the following line somewhere near the bottom of LocalSettings.php:

  require_once("$IP/extensions/Yubikey/Yubikey.php");

Theoretically, that should work out of the box.  However, you may want
to consider setting some of the following variables.

* $wgYubikeyValidationBaseURL -- This is the base URL for the
  validation server that should be used.  If not set, the default in
  php-yubico is used ('https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/verify' last I
  looked).
  [ NOTE: depending on the implementation of php-yubico, this may or
  may not work.  If it doesn't, you're stuck with verifying with
  Yubico's validation server ]
* $wgYubikeyAPIId [REQUIRED!] -- The numeric API identity.
* $wgYubikeyAPIKey -- The API key corresponding to the API identity.
  May be an empty string, but that's not recommended from a security
  point of view.

Prerequisites

Convert local user to use a Yubikey

There's no real functionality for that yet.
